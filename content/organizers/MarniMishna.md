## Biography
Marni Mishna is the deputy director of the Pacific Institute for the
Mathematical Sciences and a professor in mathematics at Simon Fraser University,
where she leads a group in applied analytic combinatorics. Her main research
interests lie in analytic and enumerative combinatorics. Marni strives to find
algorithmic, and systematic solutions to problems that arise in combinatorics.
She is interested in the development of methods to compute the asymptotics of
coefficients of combinatorial generating functions as well as the role of art
and design in mathematical communication.
