## Early Career Research Showcase

The PRIMA Early Career Researcher's Showcase is a short session for early career
participants (undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral scholars) to highlight
their areas of research. This can be done either through the poster session, or
a 10 minute presentation.


Topics for presentations at the showcase are open, and should focus on
research accomplishments of the researcher. Please fill in the [application
form](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3qLmqRb4Je6a8Pc) with the
poster/ talk details. Submissions close **August 31st, 2022**.
