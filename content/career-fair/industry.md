The PRIMA Career Fair is an excellent chance for you to recruit future
employees whose innovative problem-solving skills will contribute to the
success of your company.  The PRIMA Career Fair is an event on the PRIMA
program, which is distributed to all students, early career
researchers and senior researchers who are attending the PRIMA conference.  The
session will take place in ROOM LOCATION at the Sheraton Wall Centre from
**13:00-15:30 on Wednesday, December 7**.  It is the only PRIMA event scheduled
during this time, and as such we expect that a large proportion of PRIMA
participants will attend the Career Fair on a drop-in basis.


### Participants will include...
  * Job-ready mathematical scientists who are currently seeking
employment which matches their skills
  * Students and early career researchers who may be available for internships
or future employment
 * Faculty and other researchers from top academic institutions who may be able
to advertise opportunities at your company to students in their networks.



The session has been advertised as a stand-alone session to undergraduate and
graduate students in the mathematical sciences at Western Canadian research
universities and to graduates of the prestigious PIMS
[Math-to-Power-Industry](https://m2pi.ca) career-readiness program.  The skills
developed by mathematical scientists have valuable applications in many
industries, including (but not limited to!) financial service companies,
pharmaceuticals or biotechnology companies, communications companies, aerospace
companies or defence contractors, software companies and the health care
industry.
