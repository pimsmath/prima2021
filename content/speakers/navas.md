## Biography
Andres Navas performed studies at USACH (undergraduate), IMPA (master) and
ENS-Lyon (PhD), and later he spent one year with a postdoctoral position at IHES
(2004-2005). In 2008 he was an invited speaker at the ICM in Rio for his work on
group actions. His book "Group of circle diffeomorphisms", published by Univ. of
Chicago Press in 2011, is a standard reference on the subject. Recently, he has
done much work for the dissemination of mathematics, including several books,
collaboration with the site "Images des Math√©tiques", and the creation of the
Chilean Mathematical Festival.
