## Biography

Katherine Stange is a number theorist whose Areas of interest include elliptic
curves, Kleinian groups, algebraic divisibility sequences, Diophantine geometry,
arithmetic dynamics, and quadratic and hermitian forms. She is especially
interested in cryptography, including elliptic-curve and isogeny-based
cryptography and post-quantum lattice-based cryptography, as well as quantum
algorithms, in part for the surprising way mathematical structures can have an
outsize influence on human affairs. She enjoys problems that involve experimental,
algorithmic, and especially visual mathematics, using a computer and other
tools.
