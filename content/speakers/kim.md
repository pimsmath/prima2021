## Biography

Minhyong Kim is a mathematician working in the area of arithmetic geometry,
which explores the interaction between structures of number theory and geometry
with particular emphasis on the study of schemes of finite type over the
integers. He is especially interested in applications of topology to number
theory. Recently, he has started exploring the possibility of connections
between arithmetic geometry and quantum field theory. In his spare time, he works
rather seriously on educational outreach, including adult education, teacher
training, and motivational talks for students. He has published four books in
Korean on mathematics written for the general public.

Before Warwick, he held professorships at eight universities on three continents.
Most recently, he was research professor of number theory at the University of
Oxford and the head of their number theory research group.
