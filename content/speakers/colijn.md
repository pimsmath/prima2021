## Biography

My work is at the interface of mathematics and the epidemiology and evolution
of pathogens. I hold an Canada 150 Research Chair in Mathematics for Evolution,
Infection and Public Health. In my group we develop mathematical tools
connecting sequence data to the ecology and evolution of infections. I also
have a long-standing interest on the dynamics of diverse interacting pathogens.
For example, how does the interplay between co-infection, competition and
selection drive the development of antimicrobial resistance? To answer these
questions, my group is building new approaches to analyzing and comparing
phylogenetic trees derived from sequence data, studying tree space and
branching processes, and developing ecological and epidemiological models with
diversity in mind.
