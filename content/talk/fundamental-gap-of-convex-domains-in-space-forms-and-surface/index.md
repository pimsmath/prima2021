abstract: 'The fundamental gap is the difference of the first two eigenvalues of the
  Laplacian, which is important both in mathematics and physics. We will review many
  recent fantastic results for convex domains in $\mathbb R^n, \mathbb S^n, \mathbb
  H^n$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions.  Then we will present a very recent estimate
  for the convex domain in surfaces with positive curvature.  The last result is joint
  with G. Khan, H. Nguyen, M. Tuerkoen. '
