abstract: 'A linear space is a point-line incidence structure such that each pair
  of points is incident to exactly one line. It is regular if all lines are incident
  to the same number of points. (This is equivalent to a balanced block design with
  $\lambda=1$.)


  I will discuss linear spaces which admit a very special class of groups of automorphisms,
  called extremely primitive groups. Together with Melissa Lee, we have almost finished
  the classification of these linear spaces. In the process, we discovered some new
  interesting constructions which I will describe.
