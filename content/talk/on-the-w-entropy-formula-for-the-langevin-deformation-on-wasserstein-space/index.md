abstract: 'Inspired by Perelman''s work on the entropy formula for Ricci flow, we
  introduce the $W$-entropy and prove its monotonicity and rigidity theorem for the
  geodesics flow on the Wasserstein space over Riemannian manifold.  This improves
  an earlier result due to Lott and Villani on the displacement of the Boltzmann type
  entropy on Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. We then  introduce
  the Langevin deformation on the Wasserstein space, which interpolates the Wasserstein
  geodesic flow and the  gradient flow of the Boltzmann entropy (i.e., the heat equation
  on the underlying manifold). Moreover, we present a $W$-entropy type formula for
  the Langevin deformation.  Joint work with Songzi Li. '
