abstract: 'For a balanced  bistable reaction-diffusion equation,

  an axisymmetric traveling front has been well studied.

  We prove that an axially asymmetric traveling front with

  any positive speed does exist  in a balanced bistable reaction-diffusion

  equation.  Our method is as follows. We use a pyramidal traveling front

  for an imbalanced reaction-diffusion equation whose cross section

  has a major axis and a minor axis.

  Preserving the major axis and the minor axis

  to be given constants and taking the balanced limit,

  we obtain an axially asymmetric traveling front in a balanced bistable

  reaction-diffusion equation.

  This traveling front is monotone decreasing with respect

  to the traveling axis, and its cross section is a compact set with

  a major axis and a minor axis.
