abstract: "The Steklov eigenvalue problem has been one of the central topics in spectral\
  \ geometry over the last decade. In particular, a lot of research has been focused\
  \ on the asymptotic distribution of Steklov eigenvalues. In this talk, we investigate\
  \ asymptotics for Steklov eigenvalues on surfaces with a boundary that is only smooth\
  \ to finite order. In particular, we obtain remainder estimates in Weyl\u2019s law\
  \ with a rate of decay depending on the order of smoothness."
