abstract: We will discuss variants of matrix and tensor CUR decompositions and algorithms
  for Robust PCA and matrix completion that allow one to observe only submatrices
  or subtensors of the data. By subsampling modes, we can obtain algorithms with state-of-the-art
  runtime for these tasks. Sample applications to image and video processing will
  be discussed.
