abstract: "We would like to know for which function f(k) it is true that any oriented\
  \ graph of minimum semidegree at least f(k) necessarily contains a given oriented\
  \ path with k edges. For the directed path, f(k)=k/2 works, and perhaps this is\
  \ true for other orientations as well. We show that this is approximately the case\
  \ for large antidirected paths, and more generally, for large antidirected trees\
  \ of bounded maximum degree.\nThis is joint work with Camila Z\xE1rate."
