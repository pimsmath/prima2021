abstract: "I this talk, I will give semiorthogonal decompositions of derived categories\
  \ of several classical moduli spaces, e.g. symmetric products of curves, Brill-Noether\
  \ loci, (relative) Quot schemes, Hilbert schemes of points. In particular, they\
  \ contain a proof of Jiang\u2019s conjecture for semiorthogonal decompositions of\
  \ Quot schemes of locally free quotients. They are by-products of my research on\
  \ categorifications of wall-crossing in Donaldson-Thomas theory, and the proofs\
  \ involve techniques of derived algebraic geometry, categorical Hall algebras, matrix\
  \ factorizations and Koszul duality. "
