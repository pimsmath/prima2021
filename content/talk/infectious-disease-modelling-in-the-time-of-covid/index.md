  The COVID-19 pandemic has made some ideas in infectious disease modelling
  household names: $R_0$, $R_t$ and herd immunity were very much in the public
  eye for many months. But the pandemic also raised new challenges for infectious
  disease modelling. Much of ""classical"" infectious disease modelling focused
  on setting up a model, determining its (usually local asymptotic) behaviour,
  and discovering how its basic reproduction number depended on its parameters.
  But in the era of the pandemic, we need models that can help us interpret data
  in real time, that can cope with heterogeneity, that are suitable for modelling
  feasible actions at a range of scales, and we need models that can incorporate
  data describing viral diversity.  Some of the challenges call for
  juxtapositions of mechanistic models and statistical models, describing the
  distributions of variables we can observe. In this talk, I will describe new
  modelling and estimation approaches that we have developed in this context.
  First, I will introduce ""eventR"", which is like a basic reproduction number
  for a specific event, and outline how it can be used to help compare strategies
  for preventing transmission. Next, I will describe a mechanistic-statistical
  model with which we can estimate a key parameter for any infectious disease
  simulation: the per unit time, per contact transmission rate, as long as we
  know enough about the transmission setting. I will link these two through an
  analysis of the cluster size distributions in schools in four Canadian
  provinces in 2021, and will describe and interpret our findings about the
  transmission rates. Finally, I will discuss the broader challenges for
  infectious disease modelling in this pandemic and beyond.
