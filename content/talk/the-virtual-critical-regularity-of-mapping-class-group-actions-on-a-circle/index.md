abstract: "We prove that for each finite index subgroup H of the mapping class group\
  \ of a closed hyperbolic surface, and for each real number r larger than one, there\
  \ does not exist a faithful C-r-action (in H\xF6lder's sense) of H on a circle.\
  \ For this, we partially determine the critical regularity of faithful actions by\
  \ right-angled Artin groups on a circle. (Joint with Thomas Koberda and Cristobal\
  \ Rivas)"
