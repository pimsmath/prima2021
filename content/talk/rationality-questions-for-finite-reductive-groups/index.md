abstract: 'Complex irreducible characters of finite groups have two main invariants
  that are used to measure their rationality: their character fields and their Schur
  indices. We will discuss recent work aiming to explicitly compute these invariants
  for certain families of finite reductive groups, in particular the symplectic, special
  orthogonal, and unitary groups.'
