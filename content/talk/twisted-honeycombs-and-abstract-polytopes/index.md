abstract: |
  In the 70´s Coxeter considered the 4-dimensional regular polytopes and used
  the so-called Petrie Polygons to obtain quotients of the polytopes that, while
  having all possible rotational symmetry, lack reflectional symmetry. He called
  these objects Twisted Honeycombs. Nowadays, objects with such symmetry
  properties are often called chiral. In this talk I will review Coxeter´s
  twisted honeycombs and explore a natural way to extend Coxeter´s work to
  polytope-like structures, in particular, we shall see some properties and
  examples of so-called chiral skeletal polyhedra, and an application of them.
