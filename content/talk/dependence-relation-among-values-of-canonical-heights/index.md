abstract: "Let $d\\geq 2$ and let $H$ denote the absolute multiplicative Weil height\
  \ on $\\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}$. Let $f(z)\\in \\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}[z]$ of degree $d$ and\
  \ let $a\\in\\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}$, the multiplicative and logarithmic canonical heights\
  \ of $a$ with respect to $f$ are defined as\n\t $$\\hat{H}_f(a)=\\lim H(f^n(a))^{1/d^n}\\\
  quad \\text{and}\\quad \\hat{h}_f(a)=\\log \\hat{H}_f(a).$$\n\tLet $n$ be a positive\
  \ integer. For $1\\leq i\\leq n$, let $f_i\\in\\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}[z]$ of degree $d$\
  \ and let \n\t$a_i\\in\\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}$. \n\tIn this talk, we provide a complete\
  \ characterization of when the $\\hat{H}_{f_i}(a_i)$'s are multiplicatively dependent\
  \ modulo constant meaning there exist integers $m_1,\\ldots,m_n$ not all of which\
  \ are $0$ and $a\\in \\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}$ such that:\n\t$$\\hat{H}_{f_1}(a_1)^{m_1}\\\
  cdots\\hat{H}_{f_n}(a_n)^{m_n}=a.$$\n\tAs an immediate consequence, we characterize\
  \ all the pairs $(f,a)$ such that $\\hat{H}_f(a)$ is an algebraic number and proves\
  \ the existence of $(f,a)$ such that $\\hat{h}_f(a)$ is an irrational number. \n\
  \tThe proof uses the Medvedev-Scanlon classification of preperiodic subvarieties\
  \ under the dynamics of a split polynomial map and the construction of a certain\
  \ auxiliary polynomial. This is joint work with Jason Bell."
