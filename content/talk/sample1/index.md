  Suppose you want to open up 7 coffee shops so that people in the
  downtown area have to walk the least amount to get their morning coffee.  
  That's a classical problem in Optimal Transport, minimizing the Wasserstein 
  distance between the sum of 7 Dirac measures and the (coffee-drinking) 
  population density. But in reality things are trickier. If the 7 coffee shops go well, 
  you want to open an 8th and a 9th and you want to remain optimal in this respect 
  (and the first 7 are already fixed). We find optimal rates for this problem in $W_2$ 
  in all dimensions. Analytic Number Theory makes an appearance and, in fact, 
  Optimal Transport can tell us something new about $\sqrt{2}$.  All of this is also 
  related to the question of approximating an integral by sampling in a number of 
  points and a conjectured extension of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality regarding
  the $W_1$ distance and testing of two measures against Lipschitz functions.
