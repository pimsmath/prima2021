abstract: 'It is a classical problem to determine the minimum and maximum genus of
  a $2$-cell embedding of a graph $G$.  However there will be many other embeddings
  with a genus between these two values: we will study the average genus across all
  of these embeddings.


  We give an overview of recent work on the average genus for fixed graphs.  We also
  discuss extensions of the problem to random graphs and random maps, and links with
  representation theory.'
