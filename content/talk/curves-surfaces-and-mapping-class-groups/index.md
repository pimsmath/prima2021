abstract: 'In this talk I will introduce you to the wonderful world of 2-dimensional
  topology! We will mainly focus on how we can use combinatorial constructions of
  curves (1-dimensional objects) on surfaces (2-dimensional objects) to answer questions
  about the group of symmetries of a surface, which we call the mapping class group.
  I intend for this talk to be accessible to folks with a wide variety of backgrounds
  including undergraduate and graduate students. '
