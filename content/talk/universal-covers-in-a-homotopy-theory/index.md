abstract: "In classical homotopy theory, two spaces are considered homotopy equivalent\
  \ if one space can be continuously deformed into the other. This theory, however,\
  \ does not respect the discrete nature of graphs. For this reason, a discrete homotopy\
  \ theory that recognizes the difference between the vertices and edges of a graph\
  \ was invented. This theory is called A-homotopy theory in honor of Ron Aktin, who\
  \ created the foundations of this theory in Q-analysis in the 1970s. A-homotopy\
  \ theory allows us to compare graphs and to compute invariants for graphs. The intended\
  \ use of these invariants is to find areas of low connectivity in a large network\
  \ where information might be missing or where the network might be made more efficient.\
  \ \n\nIn algebraic topology, each space $X$ has associated spaces $\\widetilde{X}$\
  \ and continous maps $p: \\widetilde{X} \\to X$, and each pair together $(\\widetilde{X},\
  \ p)$ is called a covering space of $X$. Under certain conditions, a space has a\
  \ covering space with special properties, called a universal cover. Among other\
  \ things, universal covers allow us to factor maps between topological spaces, which\
  \ can be quite useful. In this talk, I will give a brief introduction to A-homotopy\
  \ theory and discuss the universal covers I developed for graphs with no 3 or 4-cycles\
  \ as well as the covering graphs obtained from quotienting these universal covers.\
  \ I will end by mentioning some of the useful properties of these universal covers. "
