abstract: I'll discuss a proposed notion of geometric finiteness in the mapping class
  group, motivated by both the analogy with Kleinian groups and the geometry of extension
  groups, following Farb and Mosher's work on convex cocompactness.  This is joint
  work with Spencer Dowdall, Matthew Durham, and Alessandro Sisto.
