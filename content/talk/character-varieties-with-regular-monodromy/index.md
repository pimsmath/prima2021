abstract: 'This is based on joint work with Masoud Kamgarpour and GyeongHyeon Nam.
  Character varieties are geometric objects associated to maps from a finitely generated
  group to a reductive group. Seminal work by Hausel and Rodriguez-Villegas studied
  topological properties of character varieties by counting points over finite fields.
  They considered twisted GL(n) character varieties of the fundamental group of certain
  surfaces. In this talk, we will discuss character varieties associated to an orientable
  surface with punctures, and a reductive group G with connected centre. We give a
  sufficient condition for their smoothness. Assuming regular semisimple, and regular
  unipotent monodromy, we give an explicit, polynomial point count. This allows us
  to determine the Euler characteristic and the number of connected components. '
