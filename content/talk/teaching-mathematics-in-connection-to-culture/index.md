abstract: |
  This presentation will share our work, through the Aboriginal and Torres
  Strait Islander Mathematics Alliance (ATSIMA), in teaching mathematics in
  connection to the culture of our Communities. I will give an overview of my
  personal journey in mathematics and how this led to the development of ATSIMA.
  I will introduce the Goompi Model, which is built on the premises that
  mathematics is an intrinsic part of culture and can guide the development of
  connected, culturally responsive pedagogies in mathematics. I will then share
  some stories from the classroom to show what is possible from this approach
  and have an open dialogue across the gathering to share ideas.
