abstract: "This is the first of two talks about a \u201Cnegative\u201D spin analogue\
  \ of the Witten $r$-spin theory. In the first talk, we will present the construction\
  \ and properties of a cohomological field theory (without a flat unit) that parallels\
  \ the famous Witten r-spin class for negative spin. The class for $r=2$ was constructed\
  \ and studied by Norbury in 2017. By studying certain deformations of this class,\
  \ we use Teleman\u2019s reconstruction theorem to prove relations in the tautological\
  \ ring, and in the special case of $r=2$ they reduce to relations involving only\
  \ kappa classes which were recently conjectured by Norbury\u2013Kazarian.  \n\n\
  This is based on the following joint work with Elba Garcia-Failde (who will give\
  \ the second talk) and Alessandro Giacchetto: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15621.pdf"
