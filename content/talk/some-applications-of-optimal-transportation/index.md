abstract: 'In this talk, we will introduce some interesting applications of optimal
  transportation in various fields including a reconstruction problem in cosmology;
  a brief proof of isoperimetric inequality in geometry; and an application in image
  recognition relating to a transport between hypercubes. This talk is based on a
  series of joint work with Shibing Chen, Xu-Jia Wang, and with Gregoire Loeper.
