abstract: "Modern advances in technology have led to the generation of ever-increasing\
  \ amounts of quantitative data from biological systems, such as gene-expression\
  \ snapshots of developing cell populations in a tissue, or geometric data of residue\
  \ positions within a protein. Experimental observations are often limited to be\
  \ partial, so information about the underlying process or structure must instead\
  \ be inferred from data. Through its connection to the Schr\xF6dinger problem of\
  \ large deviations for stochastic processes, we find that entropic optimal transport\
  \ arises as a natural tool for reconstructing unobserved cellular trajectories under\
  \ precise assumptions. We develop both a theoretical and computational framework\
  \ for inferring cellular dynamics based on optimal transport, and demonstrate its\
  \ potential to extract the genetic logic underlying biological dynamics. In another\
  \ vein, we also discuss the utility of generalized notions of optimal transport\
  \ for matching and summarizing topological features in geometric structures such\
  \ as biomolecules. \n\nJoint work with (the groups of) Prof. Geoffrey Schiebinger,\
  \ Prof. L\xE9na\xEFc Chizat and Prof. Michael Stumpf.\n"
