abstract: "Hassett\u2013Tschinkel and Benoist\u2013Wittenberg recently introduced\
  \ a new rationality obstruction that refines the classical the Clemens\u2013Griffiths\
  \ intermediate Jacobian obstruction to rationality, and exhibited its strength by\
  \ showing that this new obstruction characterizes rationality for intersections\
  \ of two quadrics. We show that this phenomenon does not extend to all geometrically\
  \ rational threefolds. We construct examples of conic bundle threefolds over $\\\
  mathbb{P}^2$ that have no refined intermediate Jacobian obstruction to rationality,\
  \ yet fail to be rational. This is joint work with S. Frei, L. Ji, S. Sankar, and\
  \ I. Vogt."
