abstract: The characteristic cycle of a constructible sheaf on a projective smooth
  algebraic variety is an algebraic cycle on the cotangent bundle that computes the
  Euler characteristic of the sheaf. In this talk, we consider a rank 1 sheaf on the
  variety. For a computation of the characteristic cycle of a rank 1 sheaf, we introduce
  a general theory called partially logarithmic ramification theory, and construct
  an algebraic cycle using several invariants measuring the ramification of the sheaf,
  which is compared with the characteristic cycle.
