abstract: 'The DT/PT correspondence is a formula which relates Donaldson-Thomas invariants
  counting closed subschemes in Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and Pandharipnade-Thomas invariants
  counting stable pairs on them. It gives an economical way of formulating GW/DT correspondence
  by Maulik-Nekrasov-Okounkov-Pandharipande. The DT/PT correspondence was proved by
  wall-crossing in the derived category, where on the wall we have a special type
  of Ext-quivers called DT/PT quivers. In this talk, I will give a categorical wall-crossing
  formula for categories of matrix factorizations associated with DT/PT quivers. The
  resulting formula is a semiorthogonal decomposition which involves quasi-BPS categories,
  and is a categorical analogue of numerical DT/PT correspondence. This is a joint
  work with Tudor Padurariu. '
