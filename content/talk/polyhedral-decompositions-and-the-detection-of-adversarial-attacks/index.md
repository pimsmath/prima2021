abstract: "Previous work has shown that a neural network with the rectified linear\
  \ unit (ReLU) activation function leads to a convex polyhedral decomposition of\
  \ the input space. In this talk, we will see how one can utilize this structure\
  \ to detect and analyze adversarial attacks in the context of digital images. \n\
  \nWhen an image passes through a network containing ReLU nodes, the firing or non-firing\
  \ at a node can be encoded as a bit ($1$ for ReLU activation, $0$ for ReLU non-activation).\
  \ The sequence of all bit activations identifies the image with a bit vector, which\
  \ identifies it with a polyhedron in the decomposition. We identify ReLU bits that\
  \ are discriminators between non-adversarial and adversarial images and examine\
  \ how well collections of these discriminators can ensemble vote to build an adversarial\
  \ image detector and also present further applications of this induced geometry."
