abstract: We investigate barycenters of probability measures on Gromov hyperbolic
  spaces, toward development of convex optimization in this class of metric spaces.
  We establish a contraction property in terms of the Wasserstein distance, a deterministic
  approximation of barycenters of uniform distributions on finite points, and a kind
  of law of large numbers. These generalize the corresponding results on CAT(0)-spaces,
  up to additional terms depending on the hyperbolicity constant.
