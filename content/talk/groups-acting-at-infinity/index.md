  I will present some recent results on rigidity of group actions and flows that
  come from looking at induced actions on "boundaries at infinity".  This idea
  has a long history, going back to Selberg and Mostow. In some of my recent
  joint work, I use this approach in geometric group theory and dynamics,
  studying boundary rigidity for actions of hyperbolic groups on their Gromov
  boundary, and showing Anosov flows on 3-manifolds are determined by their
  periodic orbits. This talk will survey some of the history, philosophy and
  techniques related to proving rigidity results by looking out to infinity.
