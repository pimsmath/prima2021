abstract: "Geometric quantisation has proven an effective approach to many problems\
  \ in mathematical physics. Many examples have been shown of theories whose classical\
  \ solutions form geometric spaces with rich and interesting structures, which may\
  \ then be used for quantisation. Sometimes, however, there is just too much structure,\
  \ and it can become difficult to pick on to use. This is the case, for example,\
  \ for hyper-K\xE4hler manifolds, which come with infinite families of symplectic\
  \ forms.\n\nIn a recent work with J.E. Andersen and G. Rembado, we proposed a new\
  \ paradigm for quantisation of hyper-K\xE4hler spaces assuming sufficient symmetry,\
  \ which opens the way to exploration in many different directions. There are many\
  \ examples of spaces to which this quantisation can be applied, including several\
  \ from mathematical physics, and there are many famous results in \"ordinary\" quantisation\
  \ that should be tested for this new version, notably the famous statement that\
  \ quantisation commutes with reduction. In this talk I will give a panoramic of\
  \ known results and possible research directions, including ongoing work with M.\
  \ Mayrand."
