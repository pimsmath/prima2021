  Given a graph, we define a new stability condition for the algebraic and
  tropical moduli spaces of rational curves. Using the theory of geometric
  tropicalization, we characterize when the tropical compactification of the
  compact moduli space agrees with the theory of geometric tropicalization. In
  this talk, I will give a gentle introduction to the moduli spaces of
  graphically stable curves and their tropical counterparts, and briefly
  describe that such a tropicalization occurs only when the graph is complete
  multipartite.
