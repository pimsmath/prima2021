abstract: The construction of Kummer K3 surfaces from abelian surfaces can be generalized
  to yield higher dimensional varieties known as hyperk\"ahler varieties of Kummer
  type. Hassett and Tschinkel showed that a portion of the middle cohomology of generalized
  Kummer 4-folds may be understood as fixed loci of symplectic involutions corresponding
  to the three-torsion points of the abelian surface. In recent work with Sarah Frei,
  we have extended this result, allowing us to characterize the Galois action on the
  cohomology when working over non-closed fields.
