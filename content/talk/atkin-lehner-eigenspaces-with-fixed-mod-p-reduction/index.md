abstract: We study the dimensions of the eigenspaces for the Atkin-Lehner involutions
  acting on spaces of modular forms $M_k(\Gamma_0(Np))$, with the additional constraint
  imposed by fixing the mod $p$ Galois representation attached to the eigenforms.
  For this purpose we establish isomorphisms up to semisimplification between certain
  Hecke modules in characteristic $p$, generalizing Serre's work relating modular
  forms mod $p$ to quaternion algebras. These isomorphisms are in turn obtained via
  a delicate study of congruences in the trace formulas for Hecke and Atkin-Lehner
  operators.
