abstract: "Sir Simon Donaldson conjectured that there should exist a virtual fundamental\
  \ class on the moduli space of surfaces of general type inspired by the geometry\
  \ of complex structures on the general type surfaces. In this talk I will present\
  \ a method to construct the virtual fundamental class in the sense of Behrend-Fantechi\
  \  on the moduli stack of  lci (locally complete intersection) covers over the moduli\
  \ stack of general type surfaces with only semi-log-canonical singularities. A tautological\
  \ invariant is defined by taking the integration of the power of the first Chern\
  \ class of the CM line bundle over the virtual fundamental class. This can be taken\
  \ as a generalization of the tautological invariants on the moduli space of stable\
  \  curves to the moduli space of stable surfaces.  The method presented  can also\
  \ be applied to the moduli space of stable map spaces from semi-log-canonical surfaces\
  \ to projective varieties. \n"
