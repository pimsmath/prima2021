abstract: |
  Traditional Indigenous marriage rules have been studied extensively since the
  mid-1800s. Despite this, they have historically been cast aside as having very
  little utility. Here, I will walk through some of the interesting mathematics
  of the Gamilaraay system and show that, instead, they are in fact a very
  clever construction. Indeed, the Gamilaraay system dynamically trades off kin
  avoidance – to minimise incidence of recessive diseases – against pairwise
  cooperation, as understood through Hamilton’s rule.
