abstract: We study non-commutative projective varieties in the sense of Artin-Zhang,
  which are given by non-commutative homogeneous coordinate rings, which are finite
  over their centre. We construct moduli spaces of stable modules for these, and construct
  a symmetric obstruction theory in the CY3-case. This gives deformation invariants
  of Donaldson-Thomas type.  The simplest example is the Fermat quintic in quantum
  projective space, where the coordinates commute up to carefully chosen 5th roots
  of unity. We explore the moduli theory of finite length modules, which mixes features
  of the Hilbert scheme of commutative 3-folds, and the representation theory of quivers
  with potential.  This is joint work with Yu-Hsiang Liu, with contributions by Atsushi
  Kanazawa.
