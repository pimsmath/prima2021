abstract: 'A Kronecker coefficient $g(\lambda, \mu, \nu)$ is a non-negative integer
  that depends on three partitions $\lambda$, $\mu$, $\nu$ of a natural number $n$.
  It is the multiplicity of an irreducible representation $V^\nu$ of the symmetric
  group of degree n in the tensor (or Kronecker) product $V^\lambda \otimes V^\mu$
  of two other irreducible representations of the same group.


  The study of ways of computing Kronecker coefficients is an important topic on algebraic
  combinatorics. Several tools have been used to try to understand them, notably from
  representation theory, symmetric functions theory and Borel-Weil theory. These numbers
  generalize the well-known Littlewood-Richardson coefficients but are still very
  far to be fully grasped.


  It is known that each Kronecker coefficient can be described as an alternating sum
  of numbers of integer points in convex polytopes. In this talk we present a new
  family of polytopes that permit efficient computations on Kronecker coefficients
  associated to partitions with few parts and provides insight in the behavior of
  Murnaghan stability.'
