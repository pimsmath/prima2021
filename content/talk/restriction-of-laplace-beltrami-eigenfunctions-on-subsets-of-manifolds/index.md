abstract: "The study of eigenfunctions of Laplacians lies at the interface of several\
  \ areas of \nmathematics, including analysis, geometry, mathematical physics and\
  \ number theory. These special\nfunctions arise in physics and in partial differential\
  \ equations as modes of periodic vibration\nof drums and membranes. \n\nA fundamental\
  \ question surrounding Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions targets their\nconcentration\
  \ phenomena, via high-energy asymptotics or high-frequency behaviour. One popular\
  \ approach to this question involves studying the growth of the $L^p$ norms of these\
  \ \neigenfunctions on the ambient manifold, or on submanifolds thereof. What can\
  \ one say about\nthe behaviour of eigenfunctions on rougher sets? We will discuss\
  \ answers to this question, based on joint work with Suresh Eswarathasan."
