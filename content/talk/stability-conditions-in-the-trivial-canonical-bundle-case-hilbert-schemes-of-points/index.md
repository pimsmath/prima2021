abstract: "The construction of stability conditions on the bounded derived category\
  \ of coherent sheaves on smooth projective varieties is notoriously a difficult\
  \ problem. In this talk, I will review some results and techniques related to this\
  \ problem. I will specifically concentrate on the case of Hilbert schemes of points\
  \ on K3 surfaces and on generic abelian varieties of any dimension. This is joint\
  \ work in progress with C. Li, E. Macr\xEC and P. Stellari."
