abstract: "Exact WKB analysis consists in the Borel-resummation of the divergent series\
  \ appearing in the context of singular perturbation theory of differential equations.\
  \ \nHowever, beyond the obvious perks for those interested in genuine solutions,\
  \ e.g. of some equivariant differential systems, it also provides a way to study\
  \ asymptotic properties of certain enumerations through the generating function\
  \ method.\nApplications of these procedures include for instance constructing physical\
  \ solutions to Schr\xF6dinger equations in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, as\
  \ well as obtaining large-genus asymptotics of generalised Catalan numbers."
