abstract: |
  In 1987, physicists Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld created an idealized version of
  a sandpile in which grains of sand are piled on the vertices of a
  (combinatorial) graph and are subjected to certain avalanching rules. In the
  last three decades, there has been a broad effort in the statistical physics
  community to understand the dynamics of this model, which has a natural
  underlying algebraic structure. The sandpile monoid and the sandpile group
  encode the short and long-term dynamics of the system. Disguised under
  different names, these algebraic structures have been widely studied in
  diverse contexts including algebraic combinatorics, arithmetic geometry, and
  algebraic geometry.

  In this talk we give an introduction to the sandpile model and the algebraic
  structures attached to it. We provide a broad overview of the theory and
  discuss some of the more celebrated results. We end the talk with a discussion
  about an ongoing project that showcases some of the unresolved fundamental
  questions accessible to undergraduates.
