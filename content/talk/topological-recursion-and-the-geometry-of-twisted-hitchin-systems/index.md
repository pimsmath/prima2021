abstract: Recent work has been done to relate ideas between topological recursion
  and Higgs bundles, such as studying the relationship between topological recursion
  and the geometry of the moduli space of Higgs bundles, and the relationship between
  quantum curves and quantization.  In this talk I will discuss my current work, exploring
  these ideas in in a more general, twisted setting where the coefficient line bundle
  of the Higgs field is arbitrary.
