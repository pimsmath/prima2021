abstract: "The irreducible representations of the  Symmetric group are a classical\
  \ subject, seemingly well understood. Yet, the multiplicities in the irreducible\
  \ decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducibles, the Kronecker coefficients,\
  \ present an 80+ long standing open problem.  The problem has seen its revival in\
  \ the context of Geometric Complexity Theory for the separation of complexity classes,\
  \ the algebraic analogues of P vs NP. \n\nIn this talk we will review some recent\
  \ results on the asymptotics and complexity of Kronecker coefficients and the underlying\
  \ characters of the Symmetric group. Based on a series of joint works with Christian\
  \ Ikenmeyer and Igor Pak. "
