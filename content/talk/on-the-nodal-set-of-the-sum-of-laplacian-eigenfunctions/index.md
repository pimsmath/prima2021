abstract: 'One guiding principle is the idea that Laplacian eigenfunctions corresponding
  to larger frequencies should oscillate more.  The same principle should then also
  be true, in some form, for linear combinations of high-frequency eigenfunctions
  (in one dimension, this is Sturm-Liouville theory). Recent progress on this question
  is based on the notion of optimal transport and a very simple idea which we formalize:
  if it''s easy to buy milk, then there are must be many supermarkets (and, conversely,
  if there are only few supermarkets at least some people have to travel a large distance
  to buy milk). This turns into a geometric inequality that is interesting in its
  own right.'
