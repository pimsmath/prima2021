abstract: "Consider the problem of matching two independent sets of $N$ i.i.d. observations\
  \ from two densities $\\rho_0$ and $\\rho_1$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. For an arbitrary\
  \ continuous cost function, the optimal assignment problem looks for the matching\
  \ that minimizes the total cost. We consider instead the problem where each matching\
  \ is endowed with a Gibbs probability weight proportional to the exponential of\
  \ the negative total cost of that matching. Viewing each matching as a joint distribution\
  \ with $N$ atoms, we then take a convex combination with respect to the above Gibbs\
  \ probability measure. We show that this resulting random joint distribution converges,\
  \ as $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, to the solution of a variational problem, introduced\
  \ by F\xF6llmer, called the Schr\xF6dinger problem. Finally, we prove limiting Gaussian\
  \ fluctuations for this convergence in the form of Central Limit Theorems for integrated\
  \ test functions. This is enabled by a novel chaos decomposition for permutation\
  \ symmetric statistics, generalizing the Hoeffding decomposition for U-statistics.\
  \ Our results establish a novel passage for the transition from discrete to continuum\
  \ in Schr\xF6dinger's lazy gas experiment."
