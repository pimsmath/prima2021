abstract: 'Graphs having three distinct eigenvalues are a fundamental object of study
  in spectral graph theory.  Strongly regular graphs are the most well-studied examples.  In
  1995, at the 15th British Combinatorial Conference, Willem Haemers asked do there
  exist any connected graphs having three distinct eigenvalues apart from strongly
  regular graphs and complete bipartite graphs.  Haemer''s question prompted responses
  from Muzychuk-Klin and Van Dam who found new families of nonregular graphs having
  three distinct eigenvalues.


  Muzychuk and Klin initiated the study of a graph with three distinct eigenvalues
  via its Weisfeiler-Leman closure.  They classified such graphs whose Weisfeiler-Leman
  closure has rank at most 7.  In this talk, we extend this classification up to rank
  9.  Our results include a correction of the literature (where the rank 8 case was
  erroneously claimed to be impossible) and discussion of further study. '
