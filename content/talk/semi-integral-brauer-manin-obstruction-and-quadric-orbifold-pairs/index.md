abstract: "I will discuss local-global principles for two notions of semi-integral\
  \ points, termed Campana points and Darmon points. In particular, I will introduce\
  \ a semi-integral version of the Brauer-Manin obstruction interpolating between\
  \ Manin's classical version for rational points and the integral version developed\
  \ by Colliot-Th\xE9l\xE8ne and Xu. Lastly, we will apply these tools to study semi-integral\
  \ points on quadric orbifolds."
