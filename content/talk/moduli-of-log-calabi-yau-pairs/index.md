abstract: 'I will discuss joint work with Kenny Ascher, Dori Bejleri, Harold Blum,
  Giovanni Inchiostro, Yuchen Liu, and Xiaowei Wang on construction of moduli stacks
  and moduli spaces of log Calabi Yau pairs that can be realized as slc log Fano pairs
  with complements.  Unlike moduli of canonically polarized varieties (respectively,
  Fano varieties) in which the moduli stack of KSB stable (respectively, K semistable)
  objects is bounded for fixed volume, dimension, the objects here form unbounded
  families.  Despite this unbounded behavior, in the case of plane curve pairs (P2,
  C), we construct a projective good moduli space parameterizing S-equivalence classes
  of these slc Fanos with complements. '
