abstract: 'We consider tautological bundles and their exterior and symmetric powers
  over the Quot scheme of zero dimensional quotients over the projective line. We
  prove several results regarding the vanishing of their higher cohomology, and we
  describe the spaces of global sections via tautological constructions. This is based
  on joint work with Alina Marian, Shubham Sinha and Steven Sam. '
