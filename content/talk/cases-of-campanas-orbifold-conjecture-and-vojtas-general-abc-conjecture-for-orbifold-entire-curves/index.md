abstract: "We study  Campana's orbifold conjecture for finite ramified covers of \
  \ $\\mathbb P^2$ with three components admitting sufficiently large multiplicities.\
  \  We also prove a truncated second main theorem of level one for analytic maps\
  \ into  $\\mathbb P^2$ intersecting the coordinate lines in sufficiently high multiplicities.\
  \  In particular, the exceptional set for the later result can be described explicitly.\
  \  \n\nThis is joint work with Ji Guo.\n"
