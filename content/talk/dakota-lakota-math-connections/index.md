abstract: |
  Tribal colleges and universities have and continue to seek out connections
  between the local heritage and culture and the mainstream education content.
  In math, calls for culture to be more integrated into the classroom have been
  met with epistemological challenges as well as a dearth of math and local
  culture resources. This research project addresses both of these challenges.
  This presentation will specifically share on the collaborative development,
  evaluation, and confirmation of an epistemological framework for curriculum
  development at Sitting Bull College. Following an Indigenous Research
  Methodology, a group of tribal college math instructors, Lakota language
  immersion teachers, and fluent elders gathered to discuss D/Lakota math
  connections. Specific examples from these recorded discussions will be shared.
  The framework and the results demonstrate that math fluency and Dakota/Lakota
  language fluency can grow together.
