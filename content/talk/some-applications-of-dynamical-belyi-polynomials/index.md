abstract: ' New questions and conjectures in arithmetic dynamics are often drawn from
  a motivating analogy between objects in arithmetic geometry and objects in dynamical
  systems. A proposed analog of CM abelian varieties are post-critically finite rational
  maps on $\mathbb{P}^1$. We investigate the strength of this analogy specifically
  related to the property of potential good reduction. Our solution suggests that
  a new family of functions that we call "bicritical polynomials" may be a fruitful
  avenue for future research. '
