abstract: |
  A pangram is an expression which contains all letters of the alphabet in the
  expression’s language. An autogram is an expression which describes itself
  (correctly) by (for example) describing how many copies of each letter appear
  in the expression. The first pangrammatic autogram found in English was the
  result of an 18-month long project in the 1980’s resulting is the sentence,
  “Only the fool would take trouble to verify that his sentence was composed of
  ten a’s, three b’s, four c’s, four d’s, forty-six e’s, sixteen f’s, four g’s,
  thirteen h’s, fifteen i’s, two k’s, nine l’s, four m’s, twenty-five n’s,
  twenty-four o’s, five p’s, sixteen r’s, forty-one s’s, thirty-seven t’s, ten
  u’s, eight v’s, eight w’s, four x’s, eleven y’s, twenty-seven commas,
  twenty-three apostrophes, seven hyphens and, last but not least, a single !”
  In this presentation, Edward Doolittle, Associate Professor of Mathematics at
  First Nations University of Canada, will describe his effort to “translate”
  such sentences into the Plains Cree language. Joint work with Arok Wolvengrey,
  Professor of Linguistics at First Nations University.
