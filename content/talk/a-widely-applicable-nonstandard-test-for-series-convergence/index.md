abstract: 'The use of infinitesimal methods (nonstandard analysis) in calculus can
  simplify computations, including the determination of convergence or divergence
  of a series.  The level comparison test for series with nonnegative terms is an
  example.  Featuring a computation that is similar in difficulty to the test for
  divergence, this test hinges on whether the reciprocal of the "omegath" term of
  the series lies in the "convergence zone" or in the "divergence zone."  In this
  talk the test is described, justified, and demonstrated.  (The level comparison
  test is introduced in the textbook Calculus Set Free: Infinitesimals to the Rescue,
  Oxford University Press, 2022.)'
