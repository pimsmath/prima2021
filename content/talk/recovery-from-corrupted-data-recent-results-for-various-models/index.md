abstract: "The goal of Optimal Recovery is to uncover procedures that are worst-case\
  \ optimal for the task of learning / recovering unknown functions from a priori\
  \ information (the model) and a posteriori information (the observations). Optimal\
  \ recovery procedures can sometimes be chosen as linear maps, at least when the\
  \ observations are accurate. When they are corrupted, however, the problem becomes\
  \ more complicated, especially if the focus is put on the practical construction\
  \ of the (near) optimal procedure. This talk showcases positive results in three\
  \ situations: deterministic observation errors bounded in $\\ell_2$; deterministic\
  \ observation errors bounded in $\\ell_1$; and stochastic log-concave observation\
  \ errors.  \n"
