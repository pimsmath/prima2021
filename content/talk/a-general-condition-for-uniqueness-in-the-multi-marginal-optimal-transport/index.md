abstract: 'Multi-marginal optimal transport, a natural extension of the well-known
  classical optimal transport problem, is the problem of correlating given probability
  measures as efficiently as possible relative to a given cost function. Although
  a variety of applications have arisen over the past twelve years, the structure
  of solutions for the multi-marginal case has been difficult to address, mainly due
  to the strong dependence on the cost function.  In this talk, I will briefly outline
  the known theory for uniqueness of this problem. Next, I will present a recent joint
  work with Brendan Pass based on a general condition on the cost function that provides
  uniqueness.
