abstract: |
  Mathematics is a jungle:  a jubilee of flowering plants and mysterious
  animals.  The mathematician is a naturalist, describing the behaviours of
  whatever she encounters on her tours.  With the advent of computers and modern
  technologies, the dispatches of the naturalist can now be illustrated in full
  colour.  In my own travels, I've collected some illustrations that I hope will
  surprise and delight you.  I'll show you -- in technicolour -- some of the
  lesser-known antics of the inhabitants of the mathematical realm, including
  complex and rational numbers and the roots of polynomials.
