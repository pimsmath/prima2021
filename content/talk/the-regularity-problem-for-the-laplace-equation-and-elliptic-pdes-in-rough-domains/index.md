abstract: 'Given a bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^n$, one says that the
  $L^p$-regularity problem is solvable for the Laplace equation in $\Omega$ if, given
  any continuous function $f$ defined in $\partial \Omega$ and the harmonic extension
  $u$ of $f$ to $\Omega$, the non-tangential maximal function of the gradient of $u$
  can be controlled in $L^p$ norm by the tangential derivative of $f$ in $\partial\Omega$.
  In my talk I will review a joint result with Mourgoglou where we proved the $L^p$-regularity
  for more general domains, and a more recent result (with the additional collaboration
  of Poggi) where we extend this result to elliptic PDE''s in divergence form.
