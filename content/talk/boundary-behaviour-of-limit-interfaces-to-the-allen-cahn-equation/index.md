abstract: The Allen-Cahn equation is a semi-linear elliptic equation arising in the
  van der Waals-Cahn-Hilliard theory of phase transitions. Earlier fundamental work
  by De Giorgi, Modica, Sternberg etc. revealed intriguing relationship between the
  Allen-Cahn equation and the theory minimal surfaces. Based on the deep regularity
  theory by Hutchinson, Tonegawa and Wickramasekera, Guaraco recently introduced a
  new PDE approach to the existence of minimal surfaces via the Allen-Cahn equation
  and there have been substantial progress along this direction in the past few years.
  In this talk, we will consider the Allen-Cahn equation on bounded domains and describe
  some geometric and analytic aspects of the boundary behaviour of the limit-interfaces.
  This work is substantially supported by research grants from Hong Kong Research
  Grants Council and National Science Foundation China.
