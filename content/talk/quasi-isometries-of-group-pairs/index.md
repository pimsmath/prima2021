abstract: " A recent trend in geometric group theory is to understand the large scale\
  \ geometry of a group with respect to a collection of subgroups.  The objects of\
  \ study are pairs consisting of a finitely generated group and a finite collection\
  \ of subgroups, and there is a notion of quasi-isometry of pairs inducing an equivalence.\
  \  This relation captures classical phenomena in the study of quasi-isometric rigidity\
  \ and brings up natural questions.  The talk will introduce some of these topics\
  \ and discuss recent results obtained in joint work with Sam Hughes and Luis S\xE1\
  nchez Salda\xF1a."
