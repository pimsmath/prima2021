abstract: 'When considering proper colourings of oriented graphs, one possible approach
  is to insist that the colouring be consistent with the orientation: all edges between
  two colour classes should be oriented in the same way.  The oriented chromatic number
  of an oriented graph is the least $k$ so that there is a homomorphism from the oriented
  graph to some tournament of order $k$.  In this talk, I will present new work with
  Nir on the oriented chromatic number of random models of oriented graphs of bounded
  degree.  Previous extremal results can be used to bound the oriented chromatic number
  of a random $d$-regular oriented graph between $\Omega(\sqrt{2}^d)$ and $O(d^2 2^d)$.  Using
  colourings by doubly-regular tournaments, we improve the upper bound to $O(\sqrt{e}^d)$.  I
  will present these results and discuss an optimization result for functions over
  doubly stochastic matrices that extends the optimization result of Achlioptas and
  Naor that was central to results on chromatic numbers of unoriented random graphs.
