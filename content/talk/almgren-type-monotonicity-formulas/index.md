abstract: "In this talk, we will explore the celebrated Almgren\u2019s monotonicity\
  \ formula. This beautiful result with far-reaching consequences states that if u\
  \ is harmonic in the unit ball, then a certain frequency function $N(r)$ is non-decreasing.\
  \ Moreover, $N(r)=k$ for all $r<1$ if, and only if, $u$ is homogeneous of degree\
  \ $k$. We will then discuss some of the many applications of this formula, and recent\
  \ developments connected to it. "
