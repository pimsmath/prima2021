abstract: The question of whether stable minimal surfaces are holomorphic under suitable
  geometric conditions has been much studied, beginning with work of Lawson-Simons
  in complex projective space, and the proof of the Frankel conjecture by Siu-Yau.
  A theorem of Micallef shows that a stable minimal immersion of a complete oriented
  parabolic surface into Euclidean 4-space is holomorphic with respect to an orthogonal
  complex structure, and the same result in all dimensions if additionally the minimal
  surface has finite total curvature and genus zero. However, Arezzo, Micallef and
  Pirola gave a counterexample in general. It is therefore necessary to strengthen
  the stability condition in the general question. We will discuss some recent progress
  on this question. This is joint work with R. Schoen.
