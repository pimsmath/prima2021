abstract: 'I will discuss the irrationality at a prime $p$ of the values of irreducible
  characters of a finite group. Among $p$''-degree characters, this irrationality
  behaves very nicely due to its conection with Navarro''s refinement of the celebrated
  McKay conjecture. I will present some recent work on the continuity of $p$-irrationality
  of $p$''-degree characters, bounding almost $p$-rational characters, and bounding
  odd-degree characters. Some results are joint with G. Malle and A. Maroti.
