abstract: In this talk, motivated by recent theoretical and experimental developments
  in the physics of hyperbolic crystals, I will introduce the noncommutative Bloch
  transform of Fuchsian groups, that we call the hyperbolic Bloch transform. I will
  prove that the hyperbolic Bloch transform is injective and "asymptotically unitary"
  and I will introduce a modified, geometric, Bloch transform, that transforms wave
  functions to sections of irreducible, flat, Hermitian vector bundles over the orbit
  space and transforms the hyperbolic Laplacian into the covariant Laplacian. If time
  permits, I will talk about potential applications to hyperbolic band theory. This
  is a joint work with Steve Rayan.
