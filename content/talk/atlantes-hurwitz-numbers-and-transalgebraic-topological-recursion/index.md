abstract: 'Hurwitz numbers count covers of Riemann surfaces with given ramification
  data. The case of covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$ with one variable ramifications and a
  uniform ramification elsewhere is particularly interesting, as these numbers are
  related to the KP integrable hierarchy. A large family of such Hurwitz problems
  can be computed using topological recursion: a universal procedure, recursive on
  the Euler characteristic of the surfaces involved, which requires a spectral curve
  as input.

  The case of Atlantes Hurwitz numbers evaded this approach up to now, as it seemed
  to have the same spectral curve as completed cycles Hurwitz numbers.

  I will introduce all these notions, and explain how Atlantes Hurwitz numbers do
  satisfy a variant of topological recursion, with a transalgebraic spectral curve,
  and this distinguishes it from the completed cycles case.

  This is joint work with Vincent Bouchard and Quinten Weller.'
