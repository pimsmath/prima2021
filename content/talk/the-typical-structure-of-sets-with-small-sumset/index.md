abstract: 'One of the central objects of interest in additive combinatorics is the
  sumset $A+B= \{a+b:a \in A, b \in B\}$ of two sets $A,B$ of integers.

  Our main theorem, which improves results of Green and Morris, and of Mazur, implies
  that the following holds for every fixed $\lambda > 2$ and every $k>(\log n)^4$:
  if $\omega$ goes to infinity as $n$ goes to infinity (arbitrarily slowly), then
  almost all sets $A \subseteq [n]$ with $|A| = k$ and $ |A + A| < \lambda k$ are
  contained in an arithmetic progression of length $\lambda k/2 + \omega$.

  This is joint work with Marcelo Campos, Mauricio Collares, Rob Morris and Victor
  Souza.'
