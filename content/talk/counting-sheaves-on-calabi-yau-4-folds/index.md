abstract: 'Borisov-Joyce constructed a real virtual cycle on compact moduli spaces
  of stable sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds, using derived differential geometry. We
  constructed an algebraic virtual cycle. A key step is a localisation of Edidin-Graham''s
  square root Euler class for $SO(2n,\mathbb{C})$ bundles to the zero locus of an
  isotropic section, or to the support of an isotropic cone.

  We also develop a theory of complex Kuranishi structures on projective schemes which
  are sufficiently rigid to be equivalent to weak perfect obstruction theories, but
  sufficiently flexible to admit global complex Kuranishi charts. We apply the theory
  to the moduli spaces to prove the two virtual cycles coincide in homology after
  inverting 2 in the coefficients. In particular, when Borisov-Joyce''s real virtual
  dimension is odd, their virtual cycle is torsion.

  This is a joint work with Richard Thomas.'
