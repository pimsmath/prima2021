abstract: 'We discuss the gradient flow structure of hydrodynamic limit equations
  obtained from microscopic interacting particle systems. We first show that for a
  wide class of reversible non-degenerate interacting particle systems, their hydrodynamic
  limit equations are formally given as a gradient flow with respect to the Wasserstein
  metric with mobility. Then we discuss when such formulation can be justified rigorously,
  and how it can be applied for the study of hydrodynamic limits. This talk is based
  on an ongoing work with Kohei Hayashi.  '
