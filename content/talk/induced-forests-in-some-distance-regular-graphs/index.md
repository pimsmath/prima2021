abstract: "The celebrated Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem can be interpreted as a characterization\
  \ of the size and structure of independent sets/co-cliques of maximum size in Kneser\
  \ Graphs. Similar characterizations have been observed in a few other classes of\
  \ Distance Regular Graphs. In this talk, we will consider a closely related problem\
  \ of finding the size and structure of the biggest induced forest in a graph. This\
  \ question is inspired by a graph process known as `Bootstrap Percolation'. In this\
  \ process, given a fixed threshold $r$ and a set of \u2018initially infected\u2019\
  \ vertices, the states of vertices (either healthy or infected) are updated indiscrete\
  \ time steps: any healthy vertex with at least $r$ infected neighbours becomes itself\
  \ infected. An initially infected set of vertices percolates if the infection spreads\
  \ to the entire graph. One of the extremal questions related to this process is\
  \ to find the smallest percolating set. In the special case of $d$-regular graphs,\
  \ when  $r=d$, a set percolates exactly when its complement is independent. Meanwhile,\
  \ in the case $r=d\u22121$, a set percolates if its complement is a set of vertices\
  \ that induce a forest. We will characterize maximum induced forests in the Kneser\
  \ graph and some other families of Distance Regular Graphs."
