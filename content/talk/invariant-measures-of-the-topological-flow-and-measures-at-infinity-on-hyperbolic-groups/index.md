abstract: "We show that for every non-elementary hyperbolic group, an associated topological\
  \ \uFB02ow space admits a coding based on a transitive subshift of \uFB01nite type.\
  \ Applications include regularity results for Manhattan curves, the uniqueness of\
  \ measures of maximal Hausdorff dimension with potentials, and the real analyticity\
  \ of intersection numbers for families of dominated (Anosov) representation, thus\
  \ providing direct proof of a result established by Bridgeman et al. in 2015.\n\
  Joint work with Steve Cantrell (Chicago).\n"
