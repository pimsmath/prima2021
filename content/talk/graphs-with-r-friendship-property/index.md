abstract: "For $r\\geq 1$, a graph has $r$-friendship property if every pair of vertices\
  \ has exactly $r$ common neighbours. The motivation for this definition is from\
  \ the Friendship theorem, which is on the graphs with $1$-friendship property. The\
  \ Friendship theorem, first proved by Erd\u0151s, R\xE9nyi, and S\xF3s in 1966,\
  \ states that if $G$ is a graph in which every pair of vertices has exactly one\
  \ common neighbour, then $G$ has a universal vertex $v$ adjacent to all others,\
  \ and the graph induced by $V(G)\\setminus \\{v \\}$ is a matching. In this presentation,\
  \ we study graphs with $r$-friendship property, where $r\\geq 2$. We show all such\
  \ graphs are strongly regular. Furthermore, we prove that for any $r\\geq 2$, there\
  \ are only finitely many graphs with $r$-friendship property. This is an ongoing\
  \ joint work with Karen Gunderson."
