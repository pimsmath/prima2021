abstract: The Springer theory relates nilpotent orbits in the Lie algebra of a reductive
  algebraic group to irreducible representations of Coxeter groups. We discuss a Springer
  theory for graded Lie algebras and the character sheaves arising in this setting,
  concentrating on the construction of cuspidal character sheaves. Irreducible representations
  of Hecke algebras of complex reflection groups at roots of unity enter the description
  of character sheaves. We will explain the connection between our work and the recent
  work of Lusztig and Yun, where irreducible representations of trigonometric double
  affine Hecke algebras appear in the picture.  This is based on joint work with Kari
  Vilonen and partly with Misha Grinberg.
