abstract: |
  Indigenous cultures have been using mathematics in their lives for
  generations. In this talk, we present methods of using place-based examples in
  a trigonometry classroom using Native Hawaiian culture. Through these
  examples, we hope to increase student participation in the classroom from both
  Indigenous and non-Indigenous students as well as spread awareness of various
  cultures.
