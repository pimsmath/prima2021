abstract: On Calabi--Yau threefolds there are two types of integral invariants, quantum
  K-invariants and Gopakumar--Vafa invariants. In this talk, I will explain a joint
  project (with You-Cheng Chou) which aims to show that the quantum K-invariants and
  Gopakumar invariants are equivalent. At genus zero, this is a conjecture by Jockers--Mayr
  and Garoufalidis--Scheidegger (for the quintic), and a proof of the JMGS conjecture
  will be presented.
