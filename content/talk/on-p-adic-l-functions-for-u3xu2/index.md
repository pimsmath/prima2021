abstract: "The Ichino-Ikeda conjecture is an explicit relation between the central\
  \ L-value and squares of a certain period of automorphic forms.  \nThis conjecture\
  \ has been established by Beuzart-Plessis, Yifeng Liu, Wei Zhang, Xinwen Zhu, Chaudouard\
  \ and Zydor for unitary groups. \nI will report on a joint work in progress with\
  \ Michael Harris and Ming-Lun Hsieh on the construction of $p$-adic L-functions\
  \ for $U(3)\\times U(2)$ via the Ichino-Ikeda conjecture. "
