abstract: 'We discuss about uniqueness of ancient mean curvature flow whose rescaled
  flow stays in a one-side of a shrinker. The rescaled flow locally and smoothly converges
  to the shrinker as time goes back. Hence, the flow is the graph of a positive function
  defined on the shrinker. Therefor, a parabolic Liouville''s theorem for positive
  entire  ancient solutions gives us the uniqueness. '
