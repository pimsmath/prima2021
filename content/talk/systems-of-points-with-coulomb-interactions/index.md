abstract: |
  Large ensembles of points with Coulomb interactions arise in various
  settings of condensed matter physics, classical and quantum mechanics,
  statistical mechanics, random matrices and even approximation theory, and they
  give rise to a variety of questions pertaining to analysis, Partial
  Differential Equations and probability.  We will first review these
  motivations, then present the ''mean-field'' derivation of effective models and
  equations describing the system at the macroscopic scale. We then explain how
  to analyze the next order behavior, giving information on the configurations at
  the microscopic level and connecting with crystallization questions, and finish
  with the description of the effect of temperature.
