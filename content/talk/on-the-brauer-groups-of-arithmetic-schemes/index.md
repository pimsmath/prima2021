abstract: Let $X$ be a regular scheme projective flat over the ring of integers in
  a number field $K$, we prove a relation between the Brauer group of $X$, the geometric
  Brauer group of $X_K$ and the Tate-Shafarevich group of $Pic^0_{X/K}$,  generalizing
  a theorem of Artin and Grothendieck for arithmetic surfaces to arbitrary dimensions.
  As a result, we reduce Artin's question about the finiteness of $Br(X)$ for arithmetic
  schemes to arithmetic 3-folds.
