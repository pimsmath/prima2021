abstract: 'Among the groups of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle,
  the one which preserves a veering pair of laminations are 3-manifold groups. We
  explain motivation, previous results, and main ingredients of the proof. This is
  based on the joint work with KyeongRo Kim and Hongtaek Jung. '
