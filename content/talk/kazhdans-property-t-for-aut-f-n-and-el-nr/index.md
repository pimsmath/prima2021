abstract: |
  Kazhdan's property (T) for groups has a number of applications
  in pure and applied mathematics. I will report the recent development
  by several hands on the heavily computer assisted methods of
  proving property (T) (with math rigor), which eventually confirmed
  property (T) for $\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)$, $n>3$, thus solving a well-known problem in
  geometric group theory. I then talk about my recent human effort in
  coping with the computer assisted proof.
