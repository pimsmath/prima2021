abstract: Gromov boundary provides a useful compactification for all infinite-diameter
  Gromov hyperbolic spaces. It consists of all geodesic rays starting at a given base-point
  and it has been an essential tool in the study of the coarse geometry of hyperbolic
  groups. In this study we introduce two topological spaces that are natural analogs
  of the Gromov boundary for a larger class of metric spaces. First we construct the
  sublinearly Morse boundaries and show that it is a QI-invariant topological space
  that can be associated to all finitely generated groups. Furthermore, for many groups,
  the sublinear boundary can be identified with the Poisson boundaries of the associated
  group, thus providing a QI-invariant model for Poisson boundaries. This result answers
  the open problems regarding QI-invariant models of CAT(0) groups and the mapping
  class group. Lastly,  for a subset of the metric spaces we define a compactification
  of the sublinearly Morse boundary and show that in these cases they are naturally
  identified with the Bowditch boundary. This talk is based on  a series of joint
  work with Kasra Rafi and Giulio Tiozzo.
