abstract: "This is the second talk of the series started by Nitin Chidambaram on a\
  \ \u201Cnegative\u201D spin analogue of the Witten r-spin theory. In this second\
  \ talk, we will exploit the relation between cohomological field theories and topological\
  \ recursion to prove W-algebra constraints satisfied by the descendant potential\
  \ of the class (constructed in Nitin\u2019s talk). Furthermore, we conjecture that\
  \ this descendant potential is the r-BGW tau function of the r-KdV hierarchy, and\
  \ prove it for r=2 (confirming a conjecture of Norbury) and r=3.\n\nThis is based\
  \ on the following joint work with Nitin Chidambaram (who gave the first talk) and\
  \ Alessandro Giacchetto: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.15621.pdf"
