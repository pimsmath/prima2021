abstract: "In this talk I will present spectral features of the Dirac operator with\
  \ infi\fnite\nmass boundary conditions in a smooth bounded domain of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\
  A non-linear variational formulation to characterize its principal eigenvalue will\
  \ be presented.\nThis characterization allows for a simple proof of a Szeg\xF6 type\
  \ inequality as well\nas a new formulation of a Faber-Krahn type inequality for\
  \ this operator.\nMoreover, strong numerical evidence supporting the\nexistence\
  \ of a Faber-Krahn type inequality, will be given.\n\nThis talk is based on joint\
  \ work with Pedro Antunes, Vladimir Lotoreichik, and Thomas Ourmieres-Bonafos."
