abstract: Among infinitely many factorizations A=VV* of a psd matrix A, we seek the
  factor V that has the smallest (1,2) norm. In this talk we review the origin of
  this problem as well as existing results regarding the optimal value. We discuss
  also the conjecture that the squared (1,2) norm of V is equivalent to the (1,1)
  norm of A.
