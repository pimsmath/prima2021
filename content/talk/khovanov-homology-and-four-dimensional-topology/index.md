  Over the last forty years, most progress in four-dimensional topology came
  from gauge theory and related invariants. Khovanov homology is an invariant of
  knots in R^3 of a different kind: its construction is combinatorial, and
  connected to ideas from representation theory. There is hope that it can tell
  us more about smooth 4-manifolds; for example, Freedman, Gompf, Morrison and
  Walker suggested a strategy to disprove the 4D Poincare conjecture using
  Rasmussenâ€™s invariant from Khovanov homology. It is yet unclear whether their
  strategy can work. I will explain a new attempt to pursue it (joint work with
  Lisa Piccirillo) and some of the challenges we encountered. I will also review
  other topological applications of Khovanov homology, with regard to smoothly
  embedded surfaces in 4-manifolds.
