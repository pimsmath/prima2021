abstract: "In this talk we give survey what is currently known for Chen's flow, and\
  \ discuss some very recent results. Chen's flow is the biharmonic heat flow for\
  \ immersions, where the velocity is given by the rough Laplacian of the mean curvature\
  \ vector. This operator is known as Chen's biharmonic operator and the solutions\
  \ to the elliptic problem are called biharmonic submanifolds. The flow itself is\
  \ very similar to the mean curvature flow (this is essentially the content of Chen\u2019\
  s conjecture), however proving this requires quite different strategies compared\
  \ to the mean curvature flow. We focus on results available in low dimensions \u2013\
  \ curves, surfaces, and 4-manifolds. We provide characterisations of finite-time\
  \ singularities and global analysis. The case of curves is particularly challenging.\
  \ Here we identify a new shrinker (the Lemniscate of Bernoulli) and use some new\
  \ observations to push through the analysis. Some numerics is also presented. The\
  \ work reported on in the talk is in collaboration with Yann Bernard, Matthew Cooper,\
  \ Philip Schrader and Glen Wheeler."
