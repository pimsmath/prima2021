abstract: '$Q$-valued maps minimizing a suitably defined Dirichlet energy were introduce
  by Almgren in his proof of the optimal regularity of area minimizing currents in
  any dimension and codimension. In this talk I will discuss the extension of Almgren''s
  result to stationary $Q$-valued maps in dimension $2$.


  This is joint work with Jonas Hirsch (Leipzig).'
