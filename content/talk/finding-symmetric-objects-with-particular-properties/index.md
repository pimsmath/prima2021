abstract: "The symmetry of a discrete object (such as a graph, map or polytope, \n\
  and even a Riemann surface or 3-manifold) can be measured by its \nautomorphism\
  \ group -- the group of all structure-preserving bijections \nfrom the object to\
  \ itself. \n(For example, an automorphism of a map takes vertices to vertices, edges\
  \ \nto edges, faces to faces, and preserves incidence among these elements.)\nBut\
  \ also/conversely, objects with specified symmetry can often be \nconstructed from\
  \ groups.\n\nIn this talk I will give some examples showing how this is possible,\
  \ \nand some methods which help, and describe some significant outcomes \nof this\
  \ approach across a range of topics.\nIncluded will be some very recent developments,\
  \ including a few unexpected discoveries. \n"
