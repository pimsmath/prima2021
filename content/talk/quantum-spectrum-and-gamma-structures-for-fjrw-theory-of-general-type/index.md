abstract: In this talk, I will explain quantum spectrum and asymptotic expansions
  in FJRW theory of invertible singularities of general type. Inspired by Galkin-Golyshev-Iritani's
  Gamma conjectures for quantum cohomology of Fano manifolds, we propose Gamma conjectures
  for FJRW theory of general type. Here the Gamma structures are essential to understand
  the connection between algebraic structures of the singularities (such as Orlov's
  semiorthogonal decompositions of matrix factorizations) and the analytic structures,
  such as asymptotic expansions in FJRW theory. The talk is based on the work joint
  with Ming Zhang.
