abstract: 'Grothendieck''s Existence Theorem asserts that a coherent sheaf on a scheme
  proper over a complete local noetherian ring is the same as a compatible system
  of coherent sheaves on the thickenings of its central fiber.  This is a fundamental
  result with important applications to moduli theory.  We will discuss generalizations
  of this result to algebraic stacks beginning with a review of the characteristic
  0 situation where a satisfactory answer is known: any quotient stack $[{\rm Spec}
  A/G]$ whose invariant ring $A^G$ is a complete local k-algebra is coherently complete
  along its unique closed point.  We will report on partial progress in joint work
  with Hall and Lim on extending this result to positive characteristic.  '
