abstract: Manin's conjecture is a conjectural asymptotic formula for the counting
  function of rational points on Fano varieties, and mainly with Brian Lehmann, I
  have been studying exceptional sets arising in this conjecture. In this talk I would
  like to discuss my joint work with Brian Lehmann and Akash Sengupta on birational
  geometry of exceptional sets, then I will discuss applications of this study to
  understand the geometry of moduli spaces of curves on Fano varieties which is joint
  work with Brian Lehmann and Eric Riedl.
