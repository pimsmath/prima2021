abstract: 'The collection of parking functions under a natural Sn-action (which has
  Catalan-many orbits) has been a central object in Algebraic Combinatorics since
  the work of Haiman more than 30 years ago. One of the lines of research spawned
  around it was towards defining and studying analogous objects for real and complex
  reflection groups W; the main candidates are known as the W-non-nesting and W-non-crossing
  parking functions.

  <br><br>

  The W-non-nesting parking functions are relatively well understood; they form the
  so called algebraic W-parking-space which has a concrete interpretation as a quotient
  ring (of the ambient polynomial algebra over a system of homogeneous parameters
  that carry the reflection representation of W). The W-non-crossing parking functions
  on the other hand have defied unified explanations while simultaneously proving
  themselves central in the study of Coxeter and Artin groups (their geometric group
  theory and combinatorics) and in the representation theory of Dynkin quivers. One
  of the main open problems in the field since the early 2000''s has been to give
  a type-independent proof of the W-isomorphism between the algebraic and the non-crossing
  W-parking spaces. In this talk, I will present the first such proof, solving the
  more general Fuss version of the problem, that proceeds by comparing a collection
  of recursions that are shown to be satisfied by both objects. This relies on a variety
  of recent techniques we introduced, in particular a parabolic decomposition of the
  algebraic parking space and its relation with the spectrum of Laplacian matrices
  for reflection arrangements.'
