abstract: In this talk, I will discuss joint work with M. Engelstein, L. Li, and S.
  Mayboroda, where we introduce the notion of Dahlberg-Kenig-Pipher operators in the
  context of domains $\Omega$ with low dimensional boundaries. We show that when the
  boundary of the domain is uniformly rectifiable with small constant, then elliptic
  measure $\omega$ associated to this domain is an $A_\infty(d\sigma)$ weight with
  small constant. As consequence, we show that for $C^1$ domains, $\log (d\omega/d\sigma)
  \in \mathrm{VMO}$. One of the main difficulties in this context is the lack of outer
  graphical approximations to $\Omega$, since the exterior of $\Omega$ can be empty.
