abstract: A common approach for compressing large-scale data is through matrix sketching.
  In this talk, we consider the problem of recovering low-rank matrices or tensors
  from noisy sketches. We provide theoretical guarantees characterizing the error
  between the output of the sketching algorithm and the ground truth low-rank matrix
  or tensor. Applications of this approach to synthetic data and medical imaging data
  will be presented.
