abstract: "Interest from the machine learning community in optimal transport has surged\
  \ over the past five years. A key reason for this is that the Wasserstein metric\
  \ provides a unique way to measure the distance between data distributions\u2014\
  one that respects the geometry of the underlying space and behaves well even when\
  \ distributions lack overlapping support.\n\nIn today\u2019s talk, I will present\
  \ two recent works that leverage the benefits of the Wasserstein metric in vastly\
  \ different contexts. First, I will describe how the Wasserstein metric can be used\
  \ to define a novel notion of archetypal analysis \u2014 in which one approximates\
  \ a data distribution by a uniform probability measure on a convex polygon, so that\
  \ the vertices provide exemplars of extreme points of the data. Next, I will discuss\
  \ an application of optimal transport to collider physics, in which comparing collider\
  \ events using the Wasserstein metric allowed us to achieve state of the art accuracy\
  \ with vastly improved computational efficiency. In both cases, I will discuss both\
  \ the theoretical benefits and the computational challenges of optimal transport\
  \ in the machine learning context."
