abstract: |
  In this joint talk, we'll discuss some pedagogical methods we have developed
  and used in Applied Precalculus, a course for pre-Business majors at TCU to
  prepare them for Applied Calculus. The population of students who take this
  course frequently provides certain challenges to the instructor, so we
  implemented a new course structure in several sections of the course a few
  years ago, and it has been evolving ever since. In this new course structure,
  the course is flipped, with exposure to material happening outside of class,
  and the course is also somewhat individually-paced, incorporating
  mastery-based grading in a series of module quizzes. We will discuss our
  motivation for this course structure, details on its implementation, how it
  has evolved over time, and what challenges still remain.
