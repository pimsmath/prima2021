abstract: An important heuristic principle in the study of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami
  operator is that their properties should resemble those of polynomials. In this
  light, I will discuss oscillations and zeros for linear combinations of Laplace
  eigenfunctions on Riemannian manifolds. In particular, I will prove that zeros become
  dense in the manifold if not too many eigenfunctions are summed. Time permitting,
  I will mention related open questions on eigenfunctions sums.
