  In this talk I will explain how to use techniques from dynamical systems
  theory to study group theoretical properties of diffeomorphisms. A special
  discussion will be deserved to an old unsolved question raised by H.
  rosenberg, namely the path connectedness of the space of commuting circle
  diffeomorphisms. I will present several results on this, the most recent of
  which have been obtained in collaboration with Hélène Eynard.
