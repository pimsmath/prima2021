abstract: 'In this talk we establish two surprising types of Weyl''s laws for some
  compact

  $\mathrm{RCD}(K, N)$/Ricci limit spaces. The first type could have power growth
  of any

  order (bigger than one). The other one has an order corrected by logarithm similar
  to some fractals even though the space is 2-dimensional. Moreover the limits in
  both types can be written in terms of the singular sets of null capacities, instead
  of the regular sets. These are the first examples with such features for $\mathrm{RCD}(K,
  N)$ spaces. Our results depends crucially on analyzing and developing important
  properties of the examples constructed by Pan-Wei. Of independent interest, this
  also allows us to provide a counterexample to a conjecture by Cheeger-Colding. This
  is a joint work with Xianzhe Dai (University of California, Santa Barbara), Jiayin
  Pan (University of California, Santa Cruz) and Guofang Wei (University of California,
  Santa Barbara).'
