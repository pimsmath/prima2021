  Some of the most remarkable achievements of science are the mind-boggling
  measurements it has contributed throughout history to our collective
  understanding of the universe. For example, a simple google search will reveal
  that the radius of our galaxy is 52850 light years, and that the Andromeda
  galaxy is 2.537 million light years away. You can also find out that the mass of
  an electron is 0.00000000000000000000000000091093837 grams. Sadly, I donâ€™t think
  I will have time to discuss these great numbers in this lecture. However, I will
  mention a few simpler, but still great measurements in history and how they
  involved calculating with precision. I will also reflect on what our knowledge
  of such matters tells us about the nature of mathematics as human heritage.
