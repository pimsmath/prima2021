abstract: 'In his 1781 M\''emoire sur la th\''eorie des d\''eblais et des remblais,
  Gaspard Monge raised the optimal transport problem and studied this problem using
  some ideas from differential geometry of curves and surfaces. In this talk, I will
  make an effort for a better understanding of Monge''s m\''emoire and extend his
  ideas to hypersurfaces in Euclidean spaces. '
