abstract: ' In this talk, we will present our recent results on the local multiplicity
  formula of strongly tempered spherical subgroups. In particular, we formulate the
  epsilon dichotomy conjecture for those spherical subgroups and prove this conjecture
  for the tempered representations of endoscopy type. Globally, the corresponding
  automorphic periods are related to the central values of certain L-functions of
  symplectic type. The conjectural Ikeda--Ichino type formulas are given. This is
  a joint project with Chen Wan at Rutgers University, Newark.'
