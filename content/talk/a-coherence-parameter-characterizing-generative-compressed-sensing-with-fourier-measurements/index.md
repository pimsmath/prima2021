abstract: We study compressed sensing when the signal structure is the range of a
  (pre-trained) generative neural network (GNN) and give the first signal recovery
  guarantees when the measurements are subsampled from an orthonormal basis.  This
  includes the subsampled Fourier transform as a special case, thus allowing a measurement
  model in line with applications such as MRI.  We define a coherence parameter which
  depends upon the alignment of the orthonormal basis and the range of the GNN and
  show that small coherence implies robust signal recovery from relatively few measurements.
  Numerical experiments verify that regularizing to keep the coherence parameter small
  while training the GNN can improve performance in the signal recovery stage.
