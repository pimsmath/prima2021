abstract: I will report on the joint works with J. Brum, N. Matte-Bon and M. Triestino
  about R-focal actions of groups on the real line by homeomorphisms. I will describe
  and motivate this notion, provide some examples and give some applications to the
  problem of understanding the space of actions of a given (class of) group(s).
