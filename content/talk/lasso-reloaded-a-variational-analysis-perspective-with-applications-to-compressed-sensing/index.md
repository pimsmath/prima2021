abstract: 'Over the last few decades, the (unconstrained) LASSO

  $$

  \min_{x\in \mathbb{R}^n} \frac12 \lVert A x-b\rVert_2^2 + \lambda \lVert x\rVert_1,

  $$

  has become an indispensable tool in statistical learning, data science, and signal
  processing, thanks to its ability to efficiently recover sparse approximate solutions
  to (underdetermined) linear systems.


  In this talk, we will present a novel variational analysis of this popular optimization
  program. First, we will establish smoothness results as well as Lipschitz properties
  for the optimal value and optimal solution maps of the LASSO as functions of the
  measurement vector $b$, the sampling matrix $A$, and, most notably, the tuning parameter
  $\lambda$. Then, we will illustrate how to apply the proposed variational analysis
  in the context of compressed sensing, validating our theoretical findings with numerical
  experiments. Finally, we will discuss extensions to related optimization problems
  such as the the square-root LASSO.'
