abstract: "If $\\Sigma_{i}$ is a stable submanifold of $M_{i}$, for $i=1,2$, then\
  \ $\\Sigma_{1}\\times \\Sigma_{2} $  is a stable submanifold in $M_{1}\\times M_{2}$.\
  \ Are all the stable submanifolds in $M_{1}\\times M_{2}$ like that? \nWe will show\
  \ that is the case for specific dimensions and codimensions in the product of a\
  \ complex or quaternionic projective space with any other Riemannian manifold. We\
  \ will also talk about the behaviour of stable submanifolds under a complex structure\
  \ of the product of two complex projective spaces. We will describe how our proofs\
  \ were motivated by work that has be done by  Simons, Lawson, Ohnita, Torralbo and\
  \ Urbano. Part of this work is joint with Shuli Chen (Stanford).\n"
