abstract: Givental and Lee introduced quantum K-theory, a K-theoretic generalization
  of Gromov--Witten theory. It studies holomorphic Euler characteristics of coherent
  sheaves on moduli spaces of stable maps to given target spaces. In this talk, I
  will introduce the quantum K-theory for orbifold target spaces which generalizes
  the work of Tonita-Tseng. In genus zero, I will define a quantum K-ring which specializes
  to the full orbifold K-ring introduced by Jarvis-Kaufmann-Kimura. As an application,
  I will give a detailed description of the quantum K-ring of weighted projective
  spaces, which generalizes a result by Goldin-Harada-Holm-Kimura. This talk is based
  on joint work with Yang Zhou.
