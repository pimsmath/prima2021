abstract: "A set of permutation $\\mathcal{F} \\subset Sym(V)$ is said to be intersecting\
  \ if any two of its elements agree on some element of $V$. The intersection density\
  \ of a finite transitive permutation group $G\\leq Sym(V)$, is the maximum ratio\
  \ $\\frac{|\\mathcal{F}|\\, |V|}{|G|}$ where $\\mathcal{F}$ runs through all intersecting\
  \ sets of $G$. If the intersection density of a group is equal to 1, we say that\
  \ a group has the Erdos-Ko-Rado property. The intersection density for many groups\
  \ has been considered, mostly considering which groups have the Erdos-Ko-Rado property.\
  \ In this talk we will consider the intersection density of a vertex-transitive\
  \ graph $X$ which is defined to be\n$\\max \\left\\{ \\rho(G) : G \\leq Aut(X),\
  \ \\mbox{ $G$ transitive} \\right\\}$.\nI will focus on the intersection density\
  \ of the Kneser graph $K(n,3)$, for $n\\geq 7$.  \n"
