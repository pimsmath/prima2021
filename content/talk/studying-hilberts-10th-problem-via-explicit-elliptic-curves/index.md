abstract: "In 1900, Hilbert posed the following problem: \"Given a Diophantine equation\
  \ with integer coefficients: to devise a process according to which it can be determined\
  \ in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in (rational)\
  \ integers.\"\n\n\nBuilding on the work of several mathematicians, in 1970, Matiyasevich\
  \ proved that this problem has a negative answer, i.e., such a general `process'\
  \ (algorithm) does not exist.\n\n\nIn the late 1970's, Denef--Lipshitz formulated\
  \ an analogue of Hilbert's 10th problem for rings of integers of number fields.\
  \ \n\n\nIn recent years, techniques from arithmetic geometry have been used extensively\
  \ to attack this problem. One such instance is the work of Garc\xEDa-Fritz and Pasten\
  \ (from 2019) which showed that the analogue of Hilbert's 10th problem is unsolvable\
  \ in the ring of integers of number fields of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{p},\\\
  sqrt{-q})$ for positive proportions of primes $p$ and $q$. In joint work with Lei\
  \ and Sprung, we improve their proportions and extend their results in several directions."
