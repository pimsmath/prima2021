abstract: "Adversarial training is a framework widely used by practitioners to enforce\
  \ robustness of machine learning models.  During the training process, the learner\
  \ is pitted against an adversary who has the power to alter the input data.  As\
  \ a result, the learner is forced to build a model that is robust to data perturbations.\
  \  Despite the importance and relative conceptual simplicity of adversarial training,\
  \ there are many aspects that are still not well-understood (e.g. regularization\
  \ effects, geometric/analytic interpretations, tradeoff between accuracy and robustness,\
  \ etc...), particularly in the case of multiclass classification. \n\nIn this talk,\
  \ I will show that in the non-parametric setting, the adversarial training problem\
  \ is equivalent to a generalized version of the Wasserstein barycenter problem.\
  \  The connection between these problems allows us to completely characterize the\
  \ optimal adversarial strategy and to bring in tools from optimal transport to analyze\
  \ and compute optimal classifiers.  This also has implications for the parametric\
  \ setting, as the value of the generalized barycenter problem gives a universal\
  \ upper bound on the robustness/accuracy tradeoff inherent to adversarial training.\
  \ \n\n\nJoint work with Nicolas Garcia Trillos and Jakwang Kim.\n"
