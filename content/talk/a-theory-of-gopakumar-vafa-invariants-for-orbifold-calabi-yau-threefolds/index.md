abstract: We define integer valued invariants of an orbifold Calabi-Yau threefold
  $X$ with transverse ADE orbifold points. These invariants contain equivalent information
  to the Gromov-Witten invariants of $X$ and are related by a Gopakumar-Vafa like
  formula which may be regarded as a universal multiple cover / degenerate contribution
  formula for orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants. We also give sheaf theoretic definitions
  of our invariants. As examples, we give formulas for our invariants in the case
  of a (local) orbifold K3 surface. These new formulas generalize the classical Yau-Zaslow
  and Katz-Klemm-Vafa formulas. This is joint work with S. Pietromonaco.
