abstract: "For A an abelian variety defined over a number\_field, a conjecture\_of\
  \ Serre predicts that the set S of primes of ordinary reduction for A has positive\
  \ density.\_\_If A is an elliptic curve without CM, Serre proved that S has density\
  \ 1, and Elkies showed that, if L admits a real embedding, then the complement of\
  \ S, that is the set of supersingular primes, is infinite.\n\nIn this talk, I will\
  \ discuss generalizations of both Serre's and\_Elkies\u2019s theorems\_ to abelian\
  \ varieties of type IV, that is with multiplication by a CM field, which are parametrized\
  \ by unitary Shimura curves.\n\nThis talk is based on joint work in progress with\_\
  Victoria Cantoral-Farfan,\_Wanlin Li, Rachel Pries, and Yunqing\_Tang."
