abstract: The moduli stack of complexes of vector bundles over a Gorenstein Calabi-Yau
  curve, considered up to chain isomorphisms, admits a 0-shifted Poisson structure
  in the sense of Calaque-Pantev-Toen-Vaquie-Vezzosi. We will give several classical
  examples of Poisson varieties appearing in representation theory and integrable
  system, that are naturally Poisson substacks of the above mentioned stack. Using
  derive algebraic geometry, we are able to prove some new results on these Poisson
  varieties. This is a joint work with Alexander Polishchuk.
