abstract: "In this talk, I will explain how the Batyrev-Manin conjecture on rational\
  \ points can be generalized to Deligne-Mumford stacks by using twisted sectors.\
  \ In the original conjecture, the so-called a- and b-invariants are determined by\
  \ positions of the ample line bundle in question and the canonical divisor in the\
  \ N\xE9ron-Severi space relative to the pseudo-effective cone. In generalization\
  \ to stacks, we introduce orbifold versions of these algebro-geometric notions.\
  \ Once we define them suitably, the generalized conjecture is formulated more or\
  \ less in the same way as the original conjecture was. The Malle conjecture on Galois\
  \ extensions of a number field is then regarded as a special case of it. This is\
  \ a joint work with Ratko Darda."
