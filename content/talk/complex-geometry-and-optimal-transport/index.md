abstract: " Optimal transport studies the most economical movement of resources. In\
  \ other words, one considers a pile of raw material and wants to transport it to\
  \ a final configuration in a cost-efficient way. Under quite general assumptions,\
  \ the solution to this problem will be induced by a transport map where the mass\
  \ at each point in the initial distribution is sent to a unique point in the target\
  \ distribution. In this talk, we will discuss the regularity of this transport map\
  \ (i.e., whether nearby points in the first pile are sent to nearby points in the\
  \ second pile). $$ $$\nIt turns out there are both local and global obstructions\
  \ to establishing smoothness for the transport. When the cost is induced by a convex\
  \ potential, we show that the local obstruction corresponds to the curvature of\
  \ an associated K\xE4hler manifold and discuss the geometry of this curvature tensor.\
  \ In particular, we show (somewhat surprisingly) that its negativity is preserved\
  \ along K\xE4hler-Ricci flow."
