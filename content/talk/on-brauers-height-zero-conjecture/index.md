abstract: "In 1955, Richard Brauer made what was arguably the first \u201Clocal-global\u201D\
  \ conjecture in character theory.  I\u2019ll discuss the conjecture, often known\
  \ as Brauer\u2019s Height Zero Conjecture, and its recent proof due to joint work\
  \ with G. Malle, G. Navarro, and P.H. Tiep."
