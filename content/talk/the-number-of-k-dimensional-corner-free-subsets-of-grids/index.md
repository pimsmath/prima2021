abstract: "In 1975, Szemeredi proved that for every real number $\\delta > 0 $ and\
  \ every positive integer $k$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that every\
  \ subset $A$ of the set $\\{1, 2, \\cdots, N \\}$ with $|A| \\geq \\delta N$ contains\
  \ an arithmetic progression of length $k$. There has been a plethora of research\
  \ related to Szemeredi's theorem  in many areas of\n mathematics.  In 1990, Cameron\
  \ and Erdos proposed a conjecture about  counting the number of subsets of the set\
  \ $\\{1,2, \\dots, N\\}$ which do not contain an arithmetic progression of length\
  \ $k$. In the talk, we study a natural higher dimensional version of this conjecture\
  \ by counting\n the number of  subsets of the $k$-dimensional grid $\\{1,2, \\dots,\
  \ N\\}^k$ which  do not contain \n a $k$-dimensional corner that is a\n set of points\
  \ of the  \nform $\\{ a \\} \\cup \\{ a+ de_i : 1 \\leq i \\leq k \\}$ for some\
  \ $a \\in \\{1,2, \\dots, N\\}^k$ and  $d > 0$,   where $e_1,e_2, \\cdots, e_k$\
  \ is the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^k$. \nOur main tools for proof are the hypergraph\
  \ container method and the  supersaturation result\nfor $k$-dimensional corners\
  \ in sets of size $\\Theta(c_k(N))$, where $c_k(N)$ is the maximum size of a $k$-dimensional\
  \ corner-free subset of  $\\{1,2, \\dots, N\\}^k$."
