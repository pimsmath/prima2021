abstract: "The dual Specht module of the symmetric group algebra over $\\mathbb{Q}$\
  \ has two distinguished bases, namely the standard basis and Young\u2019s seminormal\
  \ basis.  We study how the Young\u2019s seminormal basis vectors are expressed in\
  \ terms of the standard basis, as well as the denominators of the coefficients in\
  \ these expressions.  We obtain closed formula for some Young\u2019s seminormal\
  \ basis vectors, as well as partial results for the denominators in general.\n\n\
  This is a joint work with Ming Fang (Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Kay Jin Lim\
  \ (Nanyang Technological University)."
