abstract: 'Caldararu-Costello-Tu defined Categorical Enumerative Invariants (CEI)
  as a set of invariants associated to a cyclic A-infinity category (with some extra
  conditions/data), that resemble the Gromov-Witten invariants in symplectic geometry.
  In this talk I will explain how one can define these invariants for Calabi-Yau A-infinity
  categories - a homotopy invariant version of cyclic - and then show the CEI are
  Morita invariant. This has applications to Mirror Symmetry and Algebraic Geometry. '
