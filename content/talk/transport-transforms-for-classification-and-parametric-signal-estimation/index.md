abstract: We will introduce a mathematical signal transform based on Optimal Transport
  Theory. It builds upon the existing Cumulative Distribution Transform by Park, Kolouri,
  Kundu, and Rohde (2018). We will present both forward (analysis) and inverse (synthesis)
  formulas for this nonlinear transform, and describe several of its properties including
  translation, scaling, convexity, and linear separability. Indeed, since this tool
  is a new signal representation based on Optimal Transport theory, it has suitable
  properties for decoding information related to certain signal displacements. We
  will describe a Wasserstein-type metric in transform space, and show applications
  in classifying (detecting) signals under random displacements, and parameter estimation
  problems for certain types of generative models.
