## Summer Schools

A number of summer schools will be run in advance of PRIMA 2022, please see the
individual summer school pages for more details and to register.

#### Summer School in Arithmetic Geometry: Theory and Computation

##### August 2nd-4th, 2021

In advance of PRIMA 2022, a number of summer schools will take place prior to
the main event at the end of the year. The first summer school on [Arithmetic
Geometry: Theory and
Computation](https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/210802-pssrcmsag) will
take place **August 2-4th, 2021**. Please see the [event
webpage](https://www.pims.math.ca/scientific-event/210802-pssrcmsag) for more
information and to register.

#### Summer School on Algebraic Geometry and High Energy Physics

##### August 23-26, 2021

The second in a series, this four-day virtual summer school aims to provide
early-career researchers with new perspectives on [algebraic geometry in
high-energy
physics](https://researchers.usask.ca/steven-rayan/research/workshops/aghep2.php).
The summer school features four mini-courses by emerging and established
researchers working at the interface of these two fields. The topics range from
derived geometry, to twisted TQFTs, to N=2 supersymmetry, to BPS algebras, to
elliptic fibrations. Please see the [event
webpage](https://researchers.usask.ca/steven-rayan/research/workshops/aghep2.php)
for more information and to register.
